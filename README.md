# Open Bookings

For the frequent flyer or a nomad venturing off the beaten trail. Open Booking is a quick and easy guide for accommodation and weather updates for the person on the go. Providing a 5 day forecast for any destination as well as a list of available hotels in the area. Just type in your location, check in date, and check out date then Open bookings will provide you with a list of hotels in the area along with a link for you to book your stay. 

## Concept
A quick and easy application for people on the go, assisting you with planning last minute trips or bouncing back after an unexpected layover, plug in your destination and it'll a give you a five day forecast and available hotels in the area.

We created this to help travellers on the go.

## Technologies

  Jquery.js

## Challenges

Here are some of the challenges we faced while working on this project
  * Conflicting schedules	
  * Lack of communication
  * Finding a specific API that would work with the same location keyword as Open Weather Map
  * Using the proper method of working through github (merging different branches)
  * Getting bogged in small details that prevented progress


## Successes 

Wins for our team
  * Isaac was a star and championed our team! 
  * Got the code to work!

## Future Development

  * Display a list of events and festivals in the area
  * Use local storage to save specific hotels/locations
  * Display more information about the hotel (price, amenities, etc.)
  * Add icons for the weather
